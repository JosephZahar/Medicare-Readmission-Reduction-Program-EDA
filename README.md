# Medicare Readmission Reduction Program EDA
Starting in October 2012, Medicare began penalizing hospitals who had excess readmissions for each of the six readmission measures (AMI, CABG, COPD, HF, HIP-KNEE replacement, PN) reported in the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program data (more background [here](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-fee-for-service-payment/acuteinpatientpps/readmissions-reduction-program.html) and [here](http://files.kff.org/attachment/Issue-Brief-Fewer-Hospital-U-turns-The-Medicare-Hospital-Readmission-Reduction-Program)).\\

For each of the six readmission measures (AMI, CABG, COPD, HF, HIP-KNEE replacement, PN) reported in the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program data, what is the distribution of the excessive readmission ratio by key hospital characteristics (for example, by hospital type, hospital ownership, and state)? Using visualizations and statistical tests, are there any significant differences in each readmission rate by key hospital characteristics?
